// Useful if you wish to do custom animations and other things that are not included out of the box
// Register this presenter using the interface provided in Cor
// You will be passed the delegate registered on Cor
// You are responsible for calling the delegate methods for the view lifecycle if you need them
// Cor will not continue until you call back letting it know you are finished
